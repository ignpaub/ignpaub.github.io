[Practical and REliable FOundation models for Robot Manipulation (PERFORM)](https://research.fi/en/results/funding/83079)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project is funded by the Research Council of Finland and its purpose is to develop VLMs and LLMs for industrial robot manipulators to solve new tasks in novel situations.
<br>
<br>
I am currently collaborating with this project, starting on December 2025:
<ul>
    <li>Exploring ViT multi-patch-size analysis for VLM-based perception, targeting open-vocabulary recognition across scales.</li>
    <li>Investigating fault-tolerant manipulation strategies, with an emphasis on recovery behaviors in cluttered scenes.</li>
</ul>

[Autonomous mobile robots for intelligent manipulation in outdoors (AMROWA)](http://www.aurova.ua.es/amrowa)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project is funded by the spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and the European Union (PID2021-122685OB-I00) and its purpose is combining robotic manipulation techniques with mobile robotics and artificial intelligence to achieve autonomous manipulation in unstructured outdoor applications without human intervention.
<br>
<br>
I collaborated for 11 months (December 2024 - November 2025) with this project:
<ul>
    <li>Developed a new robotic platform.</li>
    <li>Designed a force feedback system for a haptic sensor.</li> 
</ul>

[Research in Deep Learning Techniques for Large Volumes of Multimodal Data](https://web.ua.es/es/plataforma-dgx/plataforma-de-computacion-dgx.html)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project was funded by the European Union through the Operational Program of the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) of the Valencian Community and provided all computational resources used since 2021 at University Institute of Computer Research (IUII).
<br>
<br>
Indirect collaboration for 40 months (September 2021 - December 2024) with this project:
<ul>
    <li>Used the computational resources for training all vision models for both object detection and instance segmentation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>


[Towards Further Integration of Intelligent Robots in Society: Navigate, Recognize and Manipulate](https://arvc.umh.es/proyectos/PROMETEO2021/index.php?lang=es&type=proy&dest=inicio&vista=normal&idp=PROMETEO2021)
<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project was funded by the Valencian Regional Government (PROMETEO/2021/075) and its purpose was  tackling activities performed by robots (repetitive, complex or dangerous) within three specific lines: navigation, recognition and manipulation. It allowed to advance the integration of robots and the performance of tasks in these environments.
<br>
<br>
I collaborated for 33 months (April 2022 - December 2024) with this project developing:
<ul>
    <li>Derived an analytic grasping method for multi-fingered grippers.</li>
    <li>Designed RGB, RGB-D, LiDAR and multispectral perception algorithms to analyze the environment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>

[Mobile Manipulation for Unstructured Outdoor Environments (MOMUE)](http://www.aurova.ua.es/momue)
<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project was funded by the spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (RTI2018-094279-B-I00) and its purpose was advancing the research and development of intelligent robotic manipulation in unstructured outdoor environments by using a mobile manipulator robot.
<br>
<br>
I collaborated for 6 months (September 2021 - February 2022) with this project:
<ul>
    <li>Developed a complete robotic pipeline to collect household waste outdoors.</li>
</ul>
</div>

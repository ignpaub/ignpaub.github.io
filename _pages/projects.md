[Autonomous mobile robots for intelligent manipulation in outdoors](http://www.aurova.ua.es/amrowa)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project is funded by the spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and the European Union (PID2021-122685OB-I00) and its purpose is combining robotic manipulation techniques with mobile robotics and artificial intelligence to achieve autonomous manipulation in unstructured outdoor applications without human intervention.
<br>
<br>
I am currently collaborating with this project, starting on December 2024:
<ul>
    <li>Researching on the detection, recognition and location of household solid waste present in urban and/or urbanised settings.</li>
    <li>Designing and building a mobile loading robot to store and transport the collected waste objects.</li>    
</ul>

[Research in Deep Learning Techniques for Large Volumes of Multimodal Data](https://web.ua.es/es/plataforma-dgx/plataforma-de-computacion-dgx.html)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project was funded by the European Union through the Operational Program of the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) of the Valencian Community and provided all computational resources used since 2021 at University Institute of Computer Research (IUII).
<br>
<br>
Indirect collaboration for 40 months (September 2021 - December 2024) with this project:
<ul>
    <li>Using the computational resources for training all vision models for both object detection and instance segmentation.</li>
</ul>

<br/>


[Towards Further Integration of Intelligent Robots in Society: Navigate, Recognize and Manipulate](https://arvc.umh.es/proyectos/PROMETEO2021/index.php?lang=es&type=proy&dest=inicio&vista=normal&idp=PROMETEO2021)
<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project was funded by the Valencian Regional Government (PROMETEO/2021/075) and its purpose was  tackling activities performed by robots (repetitive, complex or dangerous) within three specific lines: navigation, recognition and manipulation. It allowed to advance the integration of robots and the performance of tasks in these environments.
<br>
<br>
I collaborated for 33 months (April 2022 - December 2024) with this project developing:
<ul>
    <li>Upgrades in BLUE robotic platform.</li>
    <li>New grasping algoritmhs for multi fingered grippers.</li>
    <li>Object detection and segmentation in both RGB and LiDAR images.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>

[Mobile Manipulation for Unstructured Outdoor Environments (MOMUE)](http://www.aurova.ua.es/momue)
<div style="text-align:justify;">
This project was funded by the spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (RTI2018-094279-B-I00) and its purpose was advancing the research and development of intelligent robotic manipulation in unstructured outdoor environments by using a mobile manipulator robot.
<br>
<br>
I collaborated for 6 months (September 2021 - February 2022) with this project developing:
<ul>
    <li>Vision modules to allow instance segmentation in outdoor environments.</li>
    <li>Communications among all modules to allow the succesful picking of objects with the BLUE robotic platform by using ROS, C++ and Python.</li>
</ul>

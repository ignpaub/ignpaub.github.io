Hello! My name is Ignacio de Loyola PÃ¡ez Ubieta. I am a Research Assistant and Adjunct Professor of Automation and Robotics at the University of Alicante inside [AUROVA](http://www.aurova.ua.es/). My Ph.D. thesis was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Santiago T. Puente](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/en/puente-mendez-santiago-timoteo/2771) and comprehends several topics, including robotics, computer vision and grasping.

My main research interest is robotics, concretely grasping and computer vision techniques both inside and outside the domain of Deep Learning. However, I am also curious about Demonstration learning - anything that could broad my knowledge!

I am actively seeking for a job or a PostDoc in any of the above topics (starting in November/December 2025). However, I am quite open-minded and, so if you have an idea or an ambitious project, I am your guy!

For more details check out [the latest news](https://ignpaub.github.io/news/) or have a look at [my publications](https://ignpaub.github.io/publications/) and [projects](https://ignpaub.github.io/projects/). If you are a Bachelor or Master student, check [teaching & student supervision](https://ignpaub.github.io/teaching_student_supervision) section.

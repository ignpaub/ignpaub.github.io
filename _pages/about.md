Hello! My name is Ignacio de Loyola Páez Ubieta. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Tampere University (Finland) at the [CogRob](https://research.tuni.fi/cogrob/) laboratory. My Ph.D. thesis was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Santiago T. Puente](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/en/puente-mendez-santiago-timoteo/2771) and comprehended several topics, including robotics, computer vision and grasping.

My main research interest is robotics, concretely grasping and perception by using foundation models like LLMs, VLMs and VLAs.

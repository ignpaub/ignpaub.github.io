Hello! My name is Ignacio de Loyola Páez Ubieta. I am a PostDoctoral Research Fellow at Tampere University (Finland) inside [CogRob](https://research.tuni.fi/cogrob/) laboratory. My Ph.D. thesis was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Santiago T. Puente](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/en/puente-mendez-santiago-timoteo/2771) and comprehended several topics, including robotics, computer vision and grasping.

My main research interest is robotics, concretely grasping and computer vision techniques both inside and outside the domain of Deep Learning. However, I am also curious about Demonstration learning and LLMs and VLMs!

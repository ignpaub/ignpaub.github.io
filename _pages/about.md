Hello! My name is Ignacio de Loyola PÃ¡ez Ubieta. I am a Research Assistant, Adjunct Professor of Automation and Robotics and PhD student at University of Alicante inside [AUROVA](http://www.aurova.ua.es/). My thesis is supervised by [Prof. Dr. Santiago T. Puente](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/en/puente-mendez-santiago-timoteo/2771) and comprehends several topics, including robotics, computer vision and grasping.

My main research interest is robotics, concretely grasping and computer vision techniques both inside and outside the domain of Deep Learning. However, I am also curious about Demonstration learning and micro/nano-robotics - anything that could broad my knowledge!

I am actively searching for a PostDoc in any topic related to those described above (starting on December 2025). However, I am quite open-minded and, if you have an idea or an ambitious project, I am your guy!

For more details check out [the latest news](https://ignpaub.github.io/news/) or have a look at [my publications](https://ignpaub.github.io/publications/) and [projects](https://ignpaub.github.io/projects/). If you are a Bachelor or Master student, check [teaching & student supervision](https://ignpaub.github.io/teaching_student_supervision) section.

Finally, for more information and contact, check [CV](/files/curriculum_american_2024.pdf). Hope to hear from you soon!
